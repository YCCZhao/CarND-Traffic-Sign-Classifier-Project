## Data Set Summary & Exploration

### 1.Basic Summary of the Data Set. 

I used the numpy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is 32x32x3
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

### 2. Exploratory Visualization of the Dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. 

First I sampled 25 images from the training set. I learned that it is hard to classify some of the images by human eyes.

Then I explored the class distribution in each set. It is noted that class distribution is not uniform, meaning some classes
have more data. 

!distribution][./examples/class_distribution.png]

### 3. Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Preprocessed the image data. 

When exploring the dataset, it was noted that some classes have more dataset than other. This could lead to poor model. For example,
training dataset consists of 90% class 1 data, and 10% class 2 data. Model would always predict class 1, and it would yield a 90% 
accuracy. However it is not a good model for prediction. Therefore training data were balanced so that each class has similar number
of training dataset.

Now the class distribution looked like this:
![balance][./examples/after_balancing.png]

After obtaining even distributed training dataset. Data augmentation is performed. [Image Augmentation Library](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug) is used.

For each image in the balanced training set, 20 new images were generated: 
- 5 of them were sheared by -5 to 5 degrees, 
- 5 of them were translated in the x and/or y direction with 7 degrees, 
- 5 of them were scaled by -10 to +10 percent, 
- and rest of them were roated by -15 to 15 degrees.

These augmentation methods were used because images generated by them could still be recognized as traffic signs. flipped images or
images rotated by 90 degrees would not be good training examples, as traffic signs are rarely presented like that in real life.

The final training dataset has the size of 164367.
The next step is to convert RGB images to grayscale. In this way, the features were compressed while reserving important information.
Belows are the sample images after converting to grayscale
![balance][./examples/gray_scale]

Finally, images were normalized, so that the minimum, and maximum values of each dataset were 0, and 255.
Belows are them sample images after normalization.

#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. 
The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an ....

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. 
The results on the training, validation and test sets of my final model were:
* training set accuracy of 99.8%
* validation set accuracy of 97%
* test set accuracy of 95.2%

* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? 
* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?
If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?


* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
* What were some problems with the initial architecture?

## Test a Model on New Images

### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. 
Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![new_image1][./new_images/constrt]![new_image2][./new_images/ROW]![new_image3][./new_images/speed_limit_60]![new_image4][./new_images/stop]![new_image5][./new_images/yield]

The first image might be difficult to classify because ...

### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. 
At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set 

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| U-turn     			| U-turn 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| 100 km/h	      		| Bumpy Road					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of ...

### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. 
Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|

For the second image ...
