## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks were built to classify traffic signs. I trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I then tried out the model on images of German traffic signs that I found on the web..

For the submission, please see: 
* the [Ipython notebook](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) with the code
* the code exported as an [html](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html) file
* a [writeup report](./writeup.md)

## Dependencies
